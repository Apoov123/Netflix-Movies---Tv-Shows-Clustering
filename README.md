## Problem Statement

The goal of this project is to find similarity within groups of people to build a movie recommendation system for users. We are going to analyze a dataset from the Netflix database to explore the characteristics that people share in movies. We have experienced it ourselves or have been in the room, the endless scrolling of selecting what to watch. Users spend more time deciding what to watch than watching their movie.

## Data Summary

This dataset consists of tv shows and movies available on Netflix as of 2019. The dataset is collected from Fixable which is a third-party Netflix search engine. In 2018, they released an interesting report which shows that the number of TV shows on Netflix has nearly tripled since 2010. The streaming serviceâ€™s number of movies has decreased by more than 2,000 titles since 2010, while its number of TV shows has nearly tripled. It will be interesting to explore what all other insights can be obtained from the same dataset. Integrating this dataset with other external datasets such as IMDB ratings, rotten tomatoes can also provide many interesting findings.

## Steps Involved

The full code for this article can be found here. It is implemented in Python and different clustering algorithms are used. Below is a brief description of the general approach that I employed:

Data cleaning and pre-processing: Here I checked and dealt with missing and duplicate variables from the data set as these can grossly affect the performance of different machine learning algorithms (many algorithms do not tolerate missing data).

Exploratory Data Analysis: Here I wanted to gain important statistical insights from the data and the things that I checked for were the distributions of the different attributes, correlations of the attributes with each other and the target variable and I calculated important odds and proportions for the categorical attributes.

Clustering: Clustering or cluster analysis is a machine learning technique, which groups the unlabelled dataset. It can be defined as "A way of grouping the data points into different clusters, consisting of similar data points. The objects with the possible similarities remain in a group that has less or no similarities with another group." It does it by finding some similar patterns in the unlabelled dataset such as shape, size, colour, behaviour, etc., and divides them as per the presence and absence of those similar patterns. It is an unsupervised learning method; hence no supervision is provided to the algorithm, and it deals with the unlabeled dataset. After applying this clustering technique, each cluster or group is provided with a cluster-ID. ML systems can use this id to simplify the processing of large and complex datasets.

## Conclusion

K-MEANS
From the elbow graph and silhouette analysis, the best model has a silhouette score of 0.49346 produced with 8 Clusters using K Means Algorithm The model also had a Davies-Bouding Index of 0.8395 and Calinski-Harbaz Score of 3353

Hierarchical Clustering
Using dendograms and comparing various distance thresholds, a distance of 20 produced the highest silhouette score of 0.495390 with 8 clusters The model also had a Davies-Bouding Index of 0.8295 and Calinski-Harbaz Score of 3352
